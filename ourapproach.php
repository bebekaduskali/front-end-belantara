                <p>This realization calls for prioritizing larger-scale, multi-stakeholder approach instead of sectoral silos and putting people on the same footing as environmental values, therefore, encouraging new and innovative ways for the conservation of ecosystems. Central to Belantaraâ€™s approach is facilitating multi- stakeholder forum from the ground up. Through the forum, the stakeholders centered within the ecosystem are enabled to design a conservation plan that is long-term and sustainable but also supports their economic needs. It put local communities, government authorities,    s, and businesses as the key actors for the change.</p>
